# FlashMeter App

The FlashMeter App is a Flutter application that allows users to send flashlight signals based on 
numeric combinations. The exact purpose of the app is to facilitate PIN entry for new 
german electricity meters, known as Smart Meters. 
This is achieved by allowing the user to input the numeric combination in advance into the app, 
which then outputs the PIN using the flashlight of the smartphone.

For example:
entering the numeric combination 1234 will result in the flashlight flashing as follows: 
Once, Pause, Twice, Pause, Thrice, Pause, Four times, Pause.
